Many a times I have failed to make a 20 time. It started with the idea to prototype a new kind of boat, but that qiuckly fell through as I 
was swamped by trying to learn JS and HTML. As the stress mounted of not having an ongoing 20 time I searched for a subject, anything. 
After coming across the game paperclips (highly reccomend you play it) and Mr.Osudar telling me not to play it, the withdrawls from the game
led me to decide my second attempt at a 20 time: make a paperclips clone. Once again the cruel mistress that is misfortune had her way, and
I lost a full days progress as I didnt make a commit and my computer crashed (damn it atomic comits may have some merit, im sorry Mr.O).
My second attempt at a stage one planning log was un-motivated and was once again washed away by Khan academy (this time it was cyphers).
Now with the deadline of 20time looming over me I pretended it didn'texist, and instead, I opted to focus on my twitter bot. The twitter 
bot worked spectacularly but I still dont have a 20time.

It's now a month later and the deadline passed. Sitting at home, bored because im pulling an all nighter (will include a how to in a separate file
of this repo, theres a technique to it) and the fact that I dont know my WPM typing speed. The idea nags me for a good few minutes until my
curiosity becomes more important than whatever I was doing. I try a few run throughs and a few sights, after a while I settle on
https://www.keyhero.com/free-typing-test/ and get somewhere in the range of 37 WPM.

For the next half-week about once a day in compsci I take a crack at beating the prevous days score. On the 16th after a competition with
Jason I realize that my hands are skipping all over the key board and im looking down from the screen frequently. I tried not moving my 
hands and only looking at the screen and my score whent from near 50 WPM to 30. After thingking how much faster if I practiced once a day I
realised I had stumbled across a 20time. A quick convo with Mr.Osudar confirmed that I'm going to have a 20 time after all. 

Some ground rules for how this is going to work:
1. I have to spend 30 minutes on https://www.keyhero.com/free-typing-test/ at least once a day until exams.
2. I have to not move my palms from their resting spot on the keyboard
3. I can not look at the keyboard while im typing
4. I have to take a screencap of the page at the end of every session

Hope fully at the end of this I will gain a few things. The most important exit outcome of this exercise is to improve my typing speed. 
Nearly as important I'll get a 20 time, thats pretty important/useful. Finally this will hopefully show myself that I have the self disciplin
to improve myself on a day to day basis.

On a side note everything above has been written without a commit, I'm sorry Mr.Osudar. Lets also take this oppertunity to learn atomic commits.


## Day one 2018-01-16 ##

The first session started off with a sore wrist and an abismal time of *32.51 WPM*. It seems that the not looking at the keyboard is much harder
than I origionally thought it to be. I have also noticed that the longer the text, the lower my WPM and accuracy. I hope that overtime my
consistancy will improve and this will no longer be the case. Furthermore I find that I can type much faster when im typing my thoughs, and
not words off of a screen. My final score was **33.74-78.02%**, it should be noted that this was probably the longest text I have come across so
far.

## Day two 2018-01-17 ##
 
I woke up from an nap and ate a huge dinner before this session so I was pretty drowsy. I have decided to bump the typing amount to a minimum
of 15 mins. I can do more than that but I quickly realized that half an hour every day is unreasonable. So far there is no difference 
in my speed although I did set a new record. This site gives you the option to have an account that logs your info. Final score
**40.56-82.46%. It could be worse**.
