                                                        # In The Beginning #

Many a times I have failed to make a 20 time. It started with the idea to prototype a new kind of boat, but that qiuckly fell through as I was swamped by trying to learn JS and HTML. As the stress mounted of not having an ongoing 20 time I searched for a subject, anything. 
After coming across the game paperclips (highly reccomend you play it) and Mr.Osudar telling me not to play it, the withdrawls from the game led me to decide my second attempt at a 20 time: make a paperclips clone. Once again the cruel mistress that is misfortune had her way, and I lost a full days progress as I didnt make a commit and my computer crashed (damn it atomic comits may have some merit, im sorry Mr.O). My second attempt at a stage one planning log was un-motivated and was once again washed away by Khan academy (this time it was cyphers). Now with the deadline of 20time looming over me I pretended it didn'texist, and instead, I opted to focus on my twitter bot. The twitter bot worked spectacularly but I still dont have a 20time.

It's now a month later and the deadline passed. Sitting at home, bored because im pulling an all nighter (will include a how to in a separate file of this repo, theres a technique to it) and the fact that I dont know my WPM typing speed. The idea nags me for a good few minutes until my curiosity becomes more important than whatever I was doing. I try a few run throughs and a few sights, after a while I settle on https://www.keyhero.com/free-typing-test/ and get somewhere in the range of 37 WPM.

For the next half-week about once a day in compsci I take a crack at beating the prevous days score. On the 16th after a competition with Jason I realize that my hands are skipping all over the key board and im looking down from the screen frequently. I tried not moving my hands and only looking at the screen and my score whent from near 50 WPM to 30. After thingking how much faster if I practiced once a day I realised I had stumbled across a 20time. A quick convo with Mr.Osudar confirmed that I'm going to have a 20 time after all. 

Some ground rules for how this is going to work:
1. I have to spend 30 minutes on https://www.keyhero.com/free-typing-test/ at least once a day until exams.
2. I have to not move my palms from their resting spot on the keyboard
3. I can not look at the keyboard while im typing
4. I have to take a screencap of the page at the end of every session

Hope fully at the end of this I will gain a few things. The most important exit outcome of this exercise is to improve my typing speed. 
Nearly as important I'll get a 20 time, thats pretty important/useful. Finally this will hopefully show myself that I have the self discipline to improve myself on a day to day basis.

On a side note everything above has been written without a commit, I'm sorry Mr.Osudar. Lets also take this oppertunity to learn atomic commits.


## Day one 2018-01-16 ##

The first session started off with a sore wrist and an abismal time of **32.51 WPM**. It seems that the not looking at the keyboard is much harder than I origionally thought it to be. I have also noticed that the longer the text, the lower my WPM and accuracy. I hope that overtime my consistancy will improve and this will no longer be the case. Furthermore I find that I can type much faster when im typing my thoughs, and not words off of a screen. My final score was **33.74-78.02%**, it should be noted that this was probably the longest text I have come across so far.

## Day two 2018-01-17 ##
 
I woke up from an nap and ate a huge dinner before this session so I was pretty drowsy. I have decided to bump the typing amount to a
minimum of 15 mins. I can do more than that but I quickly realized that half an hour every day is unreasonable. So far there is no difference in my speed although I did set a new record. This site gives you the option to have an account that logs your info. Final score **40.56-82.46%. It could be worse**.

## Day three 2018-01-18 ##

A new day and what a difference. It seems that im finally starting to reap the benefits of re-learning how to type. Useing my old method I was able to achieve about 40WPM. The first day I switched over I was at about 32WPM. Today I hit a record high of 52WPM. I have also done enough games that the website gives me a moving average, and thats pretty neat to see a line of best fit. Consistancy is also moving at an upward albeit at a much slower pace than WPM. Final is **44.94-82.24**.

## Day four 2018-01-19 ##

Today was a day of highs and lows. I started pretty slow because my hands where cold, but quicly rocketed up to a new highscore of **53 WPM even**. For 11 games straight I scored over 40WPM. On 5 occasions I scored over 50WPM. Theres  a pretty big dip in the WPM because I wanted to see how it would effect the results if I left the game running for a bit. During the last few days I had a horrible accuracty (as low as 78%). This kicked me out of the flow I had and really killed my motivation. Final of **42.24-82.57**.

## Day five 2018-01-20 ##

In all honesty today sucked. I didn't get a highscore, my accuracy sucked and it was a throughrly dissapointing 20 minutes. Towards the end my hands (especially my wrists) really hurt. As dumb as this sounds this might actually be taxing on my body. Well pain is progress so tomorrow should be better **39.07-82.03%**.

## Day six 2018-01-21 ##

Today was not better. Take everything that happened yesterday but multiply it by a factor of two; that being said I did learn a few things. It seems that my best performances happen in a trance. This sort of state gives me unadulterated access to my brain, without the interferance of my second guesses or micro corrections. Continuing this exersize should instill the ability to access that part of my brain without having to alter my current state. If I get distracted my score suffers, and the more my score suffers the more frustarated I get. Its not a pretty cycle. *see todays graph for the pattern * it stands out pretty well. **41.96-84.21%** Dont plateau, make progress.

## Day seven 2018-01-22 ##

The moment you cease to desire something is the moment it will present itself. My **extremely** :) wise words aside today was a better day. Split up into two sections I easily did over half an hour. The uncertanty was not present and it made a noticeable difference in my typing. Also one week, thats pretty cool. **50.03-86.97%**, not too shabby.

## Day eight 2018-01-24 ##

Yesterday was a snow day, so I didn't have to do a test (Im an idiot, I completely forgot to do it yesterday). With that being said I got a days rest and came at it hungry for records and improvement. Although this is my last log, this isn't the last time I'm going to use the WPM site. I have come to enjoy trying to beat my record at something productive, and something that I can actually put on a resume. Looking back at my original goals I accomplished them all. I improved my typing speed significantly (I got a record of **54.45WPM** today) with room to improve. I did in fact make a 20 time project, and I used atomic commits. Finally I proved to my self that I have the motivation to work at something day to day to improve myself. I have actually started running and training at lacrosse again thanks to this mentality. Lets go with todays highscore: **54.24-89.58%**.
